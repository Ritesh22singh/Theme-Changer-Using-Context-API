# This project implements a dynamic theme changer in a React application using the Context API. It allows users to switch between light and dark themes seamlessly throughout the application. The implementation utilizes React's useState, useEffect, and Context API alongside Tailwind CSS for styling.

# Key Features:

# Context API: The application utilizes React's Context API to manage the theme state globally, ensuring consistent theming across components.

# useState: React's useState hook is employed to manage the current theme state and update it dynamically based on user interaction.

# useEffect: The useEffect hook is used to apply the selected theme on component mount and update it whenever the theme changes.

# Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a simple and efficient way to create visually appealing UI components.

# By combining these technologies, the project offers users a seamless experience for toggling between light and dark themes, enhancing accessibility and user satisfaction.
